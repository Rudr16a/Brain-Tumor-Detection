## Introduction

Brain tumors are abnormal growths in the brain that can be life-threatening. Early detection through MRI imaging plays a critical role in the treatment and management of brain tumors. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify MRI images as either containing a brain tumor or being tumor-free.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment MRI images for improved model performance.
- **CNN Model**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model on a labeled dataset and evaluate its performance.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new MRI images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and neural networks

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
   cd brain-tumor-detection
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the `brain_tumor_detection.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the dataset and preprocess images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

2. **Build the Model**: Define the CNN architecture.

3. **Train the Model**: Train the model on the dataset.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify new MRI images.

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the `brain_tumor_detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on [Kaggle Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). It consists of MRI images labeled as either having a brain tumor or not.

## Model Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model consists of the following layers:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling
- Batch Normalization layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Flatten layer
- Fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with Softmax activation

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting brain tumors from MRI images. Detailed results, including training and validation accuracy/loss plots, are provided in the notebook.
